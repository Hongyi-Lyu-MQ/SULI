# This is a Python implementation of "Fine-Grained and Efficient Self-Unlearning with Layered Iteration" for IJCAI 2025 Submission

This repository contains code for class-wise and instance-wise unlearning, developed for submission to **IJCAI 2025**. The methods implemented allow selective forgetting of specific data samples from a trained model.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Run:
   - `class-wise_unlearning.ipynb` for class-wise unlearning.
   - `instance-wise_unlearning.ipynb` for instance-wise unlearning.
3. Modify the dataset and parameters as needed.

## Notes

- This repository is for the **anonymous** submission to **IJCAI 2025**.
- Do not share identifying information until after the review process.
